#Brain-Tumor-Classification
#This project applies deep learning techniques to classify brain tumors from MRI images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It includes preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation steps all within a single Jupyter Notebook.

🧠 Overview
Built with TensorFlow and Keras.

Classifies brain MRI images into different tumor types.

Visualizations included for training accuracy and loss.

Designed for medical image classification tasks.
